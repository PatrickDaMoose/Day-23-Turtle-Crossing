# Day-23-Turtle-Crossing
Day 23 Python Capstone Project - https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I have finished day 23's Capstone Project! I wanted to challenge myself, so I took on the expert difficulty of trying to create everything from scratch without assistance from the bootcamp videos! I am very happy with how it turned out

Quick rundown of what is in here:

main.py -- Main file that controls game loop and initializations of objects.
player.py -- Class that defines methods and attributes regarding the player object
car_manager.py -- Class that defines the process of looping and creating car objects for the player to navigate through
scoreboard.py -- Simple class that creates a text window using a turtle object. 

I am always trying to improve so if theres any notes please let me know!
